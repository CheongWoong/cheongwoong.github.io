I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Graduate School of AI, KAIST, affiliated with the <a href="http://sailab.kaist.ac.kr/">SAIL</a> (advisor: <a href="http://sailab.kaist.ac.kr/members/jaesik/">Jaesik Choi</a>). My research focuses on explainable AI (XAI) and natural language processing (NLP), with a particular interest in how knowledge is encoded, processed and utilized for reasoning in language models, as well as how it can be effectively extracted. My work spans two key directions: (1) analyzing the internal knowledge representations and mechanisms of language models, and (2) enhancing models by controlling or augmenting knowledge.
